# Case Study 2: Cherry Blossom Race Planning Recommendations

* Race Time Evaluation and recommendations to planning committee
* Webscraping, Exploratory Analysis, Dynamic Visualizations using Plotly

# Case Study 3: Spam Classification Deepdive using Decision Trees

* Built a Spam Classifier using Decision Tree Models (scikit-learn)
* Use of Custom Evaluation metrics and Bayesian Optimization
* Evaluate model explainability by looking at the Decision Tree structure

# Case Study 4: XGBoost, Random Forest and SVM
* Build 3 models to determine which had the best accurracy
*  The data used was anonymous and had no metadata and no data dictionary

# Case Study 5: Missing Data Analysis

* Evaluate imputation tecniques for:
   * Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
   * Missing at Random (MAR)
   * Missing Not at Random (MNAR)
* Imputation methods evaluate were: Median and KNN Imputation
   
# Case Study 6: Deep Neural Network

* Recreate the neural network in the [Searching for Exotic Particles in High-Energy Physics with Deep Learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS) paper
* Upgrade the code to TensorFlow 2.0
* Made recomendation to improve the model performance

# Case Study 7: Binary Classification

* Created and tuned a Binary Classifier using AutoML (PyCaret)
* Evaluated using a custom metric
* Evaluated global and local model explainability using Shapley
